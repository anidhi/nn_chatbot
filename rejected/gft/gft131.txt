The old man saves up money in a stocking for winter.
A beggar comes to the door.
The old woman asks his name.
'Winter.'
'Here is money, my old man, saved for you.'
The old husband comes home.
They leave the cottage, the old woman taking the door with her (reason not given), and camp out in a tree.
Robbers come and camp underneath, and quarrel over the division of their spoil.
They want change for Â£1.
One says he will have change if he goes to the devil for it.
Down falls the door.
The robbers think it is the devil, and fly, leaving the money.
The old man and woman seize it, and return to their cottage.
