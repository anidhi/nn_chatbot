Gypsy Folk Tales: Chapter VIII. Welsh-Gypsy Stories: No. 67.--Cinderella
Gypsy Folk Tales, by Francis Hindes Groome, , at sacred-texts.comA glorious version, too long to take down, and now almost forgotten.
After Cinderella's marriage the sisters live with her, and flirt with the prince.
Her children are stolen, and Cinderella is turned into a sow.
She protects the children, but at the instigation of the sisters (or stepmother) she ishunted by the prince's hounds and killed.
The three children come to the hall, and beg for the sow's liver (its special efficacy forgotten).
The children are followed and further restored to their father.
Perhaps Cinderella herself comes again to life.
