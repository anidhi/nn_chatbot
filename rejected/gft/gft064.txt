Gypsy Folk Tales: Chapter I. Turkish-Gypsy Stories: No. 4.--Story of the Bridge
Gypsy Folk Tales, by Francis Hindes Groome, , at sacred-texts.comIn olden days there were twelve brothers.
And the eldest brother, the carpenter Manoli, was making the long bridge.
One side he makes; one side falls.
The twelve brothers had one mistress, and they all had to do with her.
They called her to them, 'Dear bride.'
On her head was the tray; in her hands was a child.
Whoseso wife came first, she will come to the twelve brothers.
Manoli's wife, Lénga, will come to the twelve brothers.
Said his wife, 'Thou hast not eaten bread with me.
What has befallen thee that thou eatest not bread with me?
My ring has fallen into the water.
Go and fetch my ring.'
Her husband said, 'I will fetch thy ring out of the water.'
Up to his two breasts came the water in the depth of the bridge there.
He came into the fountain, he was drowned.
Beneath he became a talisman, the innermost foundation of the bridge.
Manoli's eyes became the great open arch of the bridge.
'God send a wind to blow, that the tray may fall from the head of her who bears it in front of Lénga.'
A snake crept out before Lénga, and she feared, and said, 'Now have I fear at sight of the snake, and am sick.
Now is it not bad for mychildren?'
Another man seized her, and sought to drown her, Manoli's wife.
She said, 'Drown me not in the water.
I have little children.'
She bowed herself over the sea, where the carpenter Manoli made the bridge.
Another man called Manoli's wife; with him she went on the road.
There, when they went on the road, he went to the tavern, he was weary; the man went, drank the juice of the grape, got drunk.
Before getting home, he killed Manoli's wife, Lénga.
