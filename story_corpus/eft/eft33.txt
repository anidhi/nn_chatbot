The Strange Visitor
A WOMAN was sitting at her reel one night; In came a pair of broad broad soles, and sat down at the fireside; 
 In came a pair of small small legs, and sat down on the broad broad soles; In came a pair of thick thick knees, and sat down on the small small legs; In came a pair of thin thin thighs, and sat down on the thick knees; In came a pair of huge huge hips, and sat down on the thin thin thighs; In came a wee wee waist, and sat down on the huge huge hips; In came a pair of broad broad shoulders, and sat down on the wee wee waist; In came a pair of small small arms, and sat down on the broad broad shoulders; In came a pair of huge huge hands, and sat down on the small small arms; In came a small small neck, and sat down on the broad broad shoulders; In came a huge huge head, and sat down on the small small neck. 'How did you get such broad broad feet?' quoth the woman. 'How did you get such small small legs?' 'How did you get such thick thick knees?' 'How did you get such thin thin thighs?' 'How did you get such big big hips?' 'How did you get such a wee wee waist?' 'How did you get such broad broad shoulders?' 'How did you get such small small arms?' 'How did you get such huge huge hands?' 'How did you get such a small small neck?' 'How did you get such a huge huge head?' 'What do you come for?'
