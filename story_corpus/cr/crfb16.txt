The Crimson Fairy Book: The Treasure Seeker
Once, long ago, in a little town that lay in the midst of high hills and wild forests, a party of shepherds sat one night in the kitchen of the inn talking over old times, and telling of the strange things that had befallen them in their youth.
Presently up spoke the silver-haired Father Martin.
Comrades, said he, you have had wonderful adventures; but I will tell you something still more astonishing that happened to myself.
Though I was still deadly cold with terror I plucked up my courage and said: Get away from me, evil spirit; I do not desire your treasures. At this the spectre grinned in my face and cried mockingly: Simpleton!
 Do you scorn your good fortune?
 Well, then, remain a ragamuffin all your days. He turned as if to go away from me, then came back again and said: Bethink yourself, bethink yourself, rogue.
I will fill your knapsack Away from me, monster, I answered, I will have nothing to do with you. When the apparition saw that I gave no heed to him he ceased to urge me, saying only: Some day you will rue this, and looked at me sadly.
Then he cried: Listen to what I say, and lay it well to heart, it may be of use to you when you come to your senses.
A vast treasure of gold and precious stones lies in safety deep under the earth.
At twilight and at high noon it is hidden, but at midnight it may be dug up.
For seven hundred years have I watched over it, but now my time has come; it is common property, let him find it who can.
So I thought to give it into your hand, having a kindness for you because you feed your flock upon my mountain. Thereupon the spectre told me exactly where the treasure lay, and how to find it.
It might be only yesterday so well do I remember every word he spoke.
Go towards the little mountains, said he, and ask there for the Black Kings Valley, and when you come to a tiny brook follow the stream till you reach the stone bridge beside the saw-mill.
Do not cross the bridge, but keep to your right along the bank till a high rock stands before you.
A bow-shot from that you will discover a little hollow like a grave.
When you find this hollow dig it out; but it will be hard work, for the earth has been pressed down into it with care.
Still, work away till you find solid rock on all sides of you, and soon you will come to a square slab of stone; force it out of the wall, and you will stand at the entrance of the treasure house.
As the apparition left off speaking my dog pricked up his ears and began to bark.
I heard the crack of a carters whip and the noise of wheels in the distance, and when I looked again the spectre had disappeared. So ended the shepherds tale; and the landlord who was listening with the rest, said shrewdly: Tell us now, Father Martin, did you go to the mountain and find what the spirit promised you; or is it a fable?
 Nay, nay, answered the graybeard.
I cannot tell if the spectre lied, for never a step did I go towards finding the hollow, for two reasons: Then Blaize, another aged shepherd, lifted up his voice.
Tis a pity, Father Martin, that your secret has grown old with you.
The party had listened with interest to this speech, but by the time it was ended the hour was late, and they went their ways homeward, leaving only one man who had sat unheeded in a corner the whole evening through.
Master Peter Bloch had once been a prosperous innkeeper, and a master-cook; but he had gone steadily down in the world for some time, and was now quite poor.
Formerly he had been a merry fellow, fond of a joke, and in the art of cooking had no equal in the town.
He could make fish-jelly, and quince fritters, and even wafer-cakes; and he gilded the ears of all his boars heads.
Peter had looked about him for a wife early in life, but unluckily his choice fell upon a woman whose evil tongue was well known in the town.
Ilse was hated by everybody, and the young folks would go miles out of their way rather than meet her, for she had some ill-word for everyone.
Therefore, when Master Peter came along, and let himself be taken in by her boasted skill as a housewife, she jumped at his offer, and they were married the next day.
But they had not got home before they began to quarrel.
Though Master Peter had no great wealth to leave behind him, still it was sad to him to be childless; and he would bemoan himself to his friends, when he laid one baby after another in the grave, saying: The lightning has been among the cherry-blossoms again, so there will be no fruit to grow ripe. But, by-and-by, he had a little daughter so strong and healthy that neither her mothers temper nor her fathers spoiling could keep her from growing up tall and beautiful.
Meanwhile the fortunes of the family had changed.
From his youth up, Master Peter had hated trouble; when he had money he spent it freely, and fed all the hungry folk who asked him for bread.
If his pockets were empty he borrowed of his neighbours, but he always took good care to prevent his scolding wife from finding out that he had done so.
His motto was: It will all come right in the end; but what it did come to was ruin for Master Peter.
He was at his wits end to know how to earn an honest living, for try as he might ill-luck seemed to pursue him, and he lost one post after another, till at last all he could do was to carry sacks of corn to the mill for his wife, who scolded him well if he was slow about it, and grudged him his portion of food.
This grieved the tender heart of his pretty daughter, who loved him dearly, and was the comfort of his life.
Peter was thinking of her as he sat in the inn kitchen and heard the shepherds talking about the buried treasure, and for her sake he resolved to go and seek for it.
Before he rose from the landlords arm-chair his plan was made, and Master Peter went home more joyful and full of hope than he had been for many a long day; but on the way he suddenly remembered that he was not yet possessed of the magic spring-root, and he stole into the house with a heavy heart, and threw himself down upon his hard straw bed.
He could neither sleep nor rest; but as soon as it was light he got up and wrote down exactly all that was to be done to find the treasure, that he might not forget anything, and when it lay clear and plain before his eyes he comforted himself with the thought that, though he must do the rough work for his wife during one more winter at least, he would not have to tread the path to the mill for the rest of his life.
Master Peter, who was well used to this sort of talk, did not disturb himself, but waited till the storm blew over, then he said calmly: Do not be annoyed, dear wife.
I have a good piece of business in hand which may turn out well for us. You with a good business?
 cried she, you are good for nothing but talk!
 I am making my will, said he, that when my hour comes my house may be in order. These unexpected words cut his daughter to the heart; she remembered that all night long she had dreamed of a newly dug grave, and at this thought she broke out into loud lamentations.
And she seized him like a fury, and tried to scratch out his eyes.
Peter now had all that was necessary to secure the magic root; he stopped up the entrance to the nest, and everything fell out exactly as Blaize had foretold.
As soon as the woodpecker came back with the root in her beak out rushed Master Peter from behind the tree and displayed the fiery red cloak so adroitly that the terrified bird dropped the root just where it could be easily seen.
All Peters plans had succeeded, and he actually held in his hand the magic root It happened that on the very day Peter had chosen for setting out, Lucia and her mother went off early to the town, leaving him to guard the house; but in spite of that he was on the point of taking his departure when it occurred to him that it might be as well first to test the much-vaunted powers of the magic root for himself.
Who knows?
 cried Dame Ilse at last, the wretch may have been idling in some tavern since early morning. Then a sudden thought startled her, and she felt for her keys.
Ah!
 Lucia, she cried, I greatly fear that your father has done himself a mischief. And they sat till morning weeping over their own fancies.
As soon as it was light they searched every corner of the house again, and examined every nail in the wall and every beam; but, luckily, Master Peter was not hanging from any of them.
After that the neighbours went out with long poles to fish in every ditch and pond, but they found nothing, and then Dame Ilse gave up the idea of ever seeing her husband again and very soon consoled herself, only wondering how the sacks of corn were to be carried to the mill in future.
She decided to buy a strong ass to do the work, and having chosen one, and after some bargaining with the owner as to its price, she went to the cupboard in the wall to fetch the money.
About a month after this, someone knocked at Dame Ilses door one day, and she went to see if it was a customer for meal; but in stepped a handsome young man, dressed like a dukes son, who greeted her respectfully, and asked after her pretty daughter as if he were an old friend, though she could not remember having ever set eyes upon him before.
However, she invited him to step into the house and be seated while he unfolded his business.
With a great air of mystery he begged permission to speak to the fair Lucia, of whose skill in needlework he had heard so much, as he had a commission to give her.
Dame Ilse had her own opinion as to what kind of commission it was likely to be Ah!
 Friedlin, why are you here?
 I thought you were a hundred miles away.
Are you come to grieve me again?
 No, dearest girl, answered he; I am come to complete your happiness and my own.
Since we last met my fortune has utterly changed; I am no longer the poor vagabond that I was then.
My rich uncle has died, leaving me money and goods in plenty, so that I dare to present myself to your mother as a suitor for your hand.
Lucias pretty blue eyes had looked up shyly as he spoke, and now a smile parted her rosy lips; and she stole a glance at her mother to see what she thought about it all; but the dame stood lost in amazement to find that her daughter, whom she could have declared had never been out of her sight, was already well acquainted with the handsome stranger, and quite willing to be his bride.
Before she had done staring, this hasty wooer had smoothed his way by covering the shining table with gold pieces as a wedding gift to the brides mother, and had filled Lucias apron into the bargain; after which the dame made no difficulties, and the matter was speedily settled.
While Ilse gathered up the gold and hid it away safely, the lovers whispered together, and what Friedlin told her seemed to make Lucia every moment more happy and contented.
Now a great hurry-burly began in the house, and preparations for the wedding went on apace.
A few days later a heavily laden waggon drove up, and out of it came so many boxes and bales that Dame Ilse was lost in wonder at the wealth of her future son-in-law.
The day for the wedding was chosen, and all their friends and neighbours were bidden to the feast.
As Lucia was trying on her bridal wreath she said to her mother: This wedding-garland would please me indeed if father Peter could lead me to the church.
If only he could come back again!
 Here we are rolling in riches while he may be nibbling at hungers table. And the very idea of such a thing made her weep, while even Dame Ilse said: I should not be sorry myself to see him come back But the fact was that she was growing quite tired of having no one to scold.
And what do you think happened?
 On the very eve of the wedding a man pushing a wheelbarrow arrived at the city gate, and paid toll upon a barrel of nails which it contained, and then made the best of his way to the brides dwelling and knocked at the door.
The bride herself peeped out of the window to see who it could be, and there stood father Peter!
 Then there was great rejoicing in the house; Lucia ran to embrace him, and even Dame Ilse held out her hand in welcome, and only said: Rogue, mend your ways, when she remembered the empty treasure cupboard.
Father Peter greeted the bridegroom, looking at him shrewdly, while the mother and daughter hastened to say all they knew in his favour, and appeared to be satisfied with him as a son-in-law.
When Dame Ilse had set something to eat before her husband, she was curious to hear his adventures, and questioned him eagerly as to why he had gone away.
God bless my native place, said he.
I have been marching through the country, and have tried every kind of work, but now I have found a job in the iron trade; only, so far, I have put more into it than I have earned by it.
This barrel of nails is my whole fortune, which I wish to give as my contribution towards the brides house furnishing. This speech roused Dame Ilse to anger, and she broke out into such shrill reproaches that the bystanders were fairly deafened, and Friedlin hastily offered Master Peter a home with Lucia and himself, promising that he should live in comfort, and be always welcome.
Peter had made the journey to the treasure mountain successfully, without being found out by anybody.
He had enjoyed himself by the way, and taken his own time, until he actually reached the little brook in the valley which it had cost him some trouble to find.
However, all went well Into the wide world, good father, or out of it, where ever my feet may chance to carry me. Why out of it?
 said Peter.
What has the world been doing to you?
 It has done nothing to me, nor I to it, he replied.
Nevertheless there is not anything left in it for me. Father Peter did his best to cheer the young man up, and invited him to sup with him at the first inn they came to, thinking that perhaps hunger and poverty were causing the strangers trouble.
Where is the good, father?
 said he.
You can give me neither help nor comfort. Who knows?
 answered Master Peter.
I might be able to do something for you.
Often enough in life help comes to us from the most unexpected quarter. The young man, thus encouraged, began his tale.
I am, said he, a crossbow-man in the service of a noble count, in whose castle I was brought up.
Not long ago my master went on a journey, and brought back with him, amongst other treasures, the portrait of a fair maiden so sweet and lovely that I lost my heart at first sight of it, and could think of nothing but how I might seek her out and marry her.
The count had told me her name, and where she lived, but laughed at my love, and absolutely refused to give me leave to go in search of her, so I was forced to run away from the castle by night.
I soon reached the little town where the maiden dwelt; but there fresh difficulties awaited me.
She lived under the care of her mother, who was so severe that she was never allowed to look out of the window, or set her foot outside the door alone, and how to make friends with her I did not know.
But at last I dressed myself as an old woman, and knocked boldly at her door.
Bitter as it was to me, I was forced to go when she bade me, and I have wandered about ever since, with grief gnawing at my heart; for how can a masterless man, without money or goods, ever hope to win the lovely Lucia?
 Master Peter, who had been listening attentively, pricked up his ears at the sound of his daughters name, and very soon found out that it was indeed with her that this young man was so deeply in love.
Your story is strange indeed, said he.
But where is the father of this maiden Alas!
 said the young man, her father is a wandering good-for-naught, who has forsaken wife and child, and gone off Father Peter was somewhat amused by this speech; but he liked the young man well, and saw that he was the very person he needed to enable him to enjoy his wealth in peace, without being separated from his dear daughter.
If you will take my advice, said he, I promise you that you shall marry this maiden whom you love so much, and that before you are many days older. Comrade, cried Friedlin indignantly, for he thought Peter did but jest with him, it is ill done to mock at an unhappy man; you had better find someone else who will let himself be taken in with your fine promises. And up he sprang, and was going off hastily, when Master Peter caught him by the arm.
Stay, hothead!
 he cried; it is no jest, and I am prepared to make good my words. Thereupon he showed him the treasure hidden under the nails, and unfolded to him his plan, which was that Friedlin should play the part of the rich son-in-law, and keep a still tongue, that they might enjoy their wealth together in peace.
The young man was overjoyed at this sudden change in his fortunes, and did not know how to thank father Peter for his generosity.
They took the road again at dawn the next morning, and soon reached a town, where Friedlin equipped himself as a gallant wooer should.
Father Peter filled his pockets with gold for the wedding dowry, and agreed with him that when all was settled he should secretly send him word that Peter might send off the waggon load of house plenishings with which the rich bridegroom was to make such a stir in the little town where the bride lived.
As they parted, father Peters last commands to Friedlin were to guard well their secret, and not even to tell it to Lucia till she was his wife.
Master Peter long enjoyed the profits of his journey to the mountain, and no rumour of it ever got abroad.
In his old age his prosperity was so great that he himself did not know how rich he was; but it was always supposed that the money was Friedlins.
He and his beloved wife lived in the greatest happiness and peace, and rose to great honour in the town.
And to this day, when the citizens wish to describe a wealthy man, they say: As rich as Peter Blochs son-in-law!
