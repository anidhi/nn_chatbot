Legends and Stories of Ireland
King O'Toole and St. Kevin WHO has not read of St. Kevin, celebrated as he has been by Moore in the melodies of his native land, with whose wild and impassioned music he has so intimately entwined his name? Through him, in the beautiful ballad whence the epigraph of this story is quoted, the world already knows that the skylark, through the intervention of the saint, never startles the morning with its joyous note in the lonely valley of Glendalough. In the same ballad, the unhappy passion which the saint inspired, and the "unholy blue" eyes of Kathleen, and the melancholy fate of the heroine by the saint's being "unused to the melting mood," are also celebrated; as well as the superstitious,  "And her ghost was seen to glide Thus has Moore given, within the limits of a ballad, the spirit of two legends of Glendalough, which otherwise the reader might have been put to the trouble of reaching after a more roundabout fashion. But luckily for those coming after him, one legend he has left to be "--touched by a hand more unworthy--" and instead of a lyrical essence, the raw material in prose is offered, nearly  "This, sir," said my guide, putting himself in an attitude, "is the chapel of King O'Toole--av coorse y'iv often heard o' King O'Toole, your honour?" "Never," said I. "Musha, thin, do you tell me so?" said be. "By gor, I thought all the world, far and near, heerd o' King O'Toole! Well, well!--but the darkness of mankind is ontellible. Well, sir, you must know, as you didn't hear it afore, that there was wanst a king, called King O'Toole, who was a fine ould king in the ould ancient times, long ago; and it was him that ownded the Churches in the airly days." "Surely," said I, "the Churches were not in King O'Toole's time?" "Oh, by no manes, your honour--throth, it's yourself that's right enough there; but you know the place is called 'The Churches,' bekase they wor built  "In this counthry, air," added he, speaking parenthetically in an undertone, "we think it onlooky to kill the redbreast, or the robin is God's own bird." Then, elevating his voice to its former pitch, he proceeded: "Well, it was all mighty good, as long as the king had his health; but, you see, in coorse o' time, the king grewn ould, by raison he was stiff in his limbs, and when he got athriken in years, his heart failed him, and he was lost intirely for want o' divarshin, bekase he couldn't go a-huntln' no longer; and, by dad, the poor king' was obleeged at last for to get a goose to divart him." Here an involuntary smile was produced by this regal mode of recreation, "the royal game of goose." "Oh, you may laugh if you like," said he, half-affronted, "but it's thruth I'm tellin' you; and the way the goose diverted him was this-a-way: you see, the goose used for to swim acrass the lake, and go down divin' for throut (and not finer throut in all Ireland, than the same throut), and cotch fish on a Friday for the king, and flew every other day round about the lake divartin' the poor king, that you'd think he'd break his sides laughin' at the frolicksome tricks av his goose; so in coorse o' time the goose was the greatest pet in the counthry, and the biggest rogue, and diverted the king to no end, and the poor king was as happy as the day was long. So that's the way it was; and all went on mighty well, antil, by dad, the goose got sthricken in years, as well as the king, and grewn stiff in the limbs, like her masther, and couldn't divert him no longer; and then it was that the poor king was lost complate, and didn't know what in the wide world to do, seein' he was done out of all divarshin, by raison that the goose was no more in the flower of her blame. "Well, the king was nigh-hand broken-hearted, and melancholy intirely, and, was walkin' one mornin' by the edge of the lake, lamentin' his cruel fate, an' thinkin' o' drownin' himself that could get no divarshin in life, when all of a suddint, turnin' round the corner beyant, who should he meet but a mighty dacent young man comin' up to him. "'God save you,' says the king (for the king was a civil-spoken gintleman, by all accounts), 'God save you, 'says he to the young man. "'God save you kindly,' says the young man to him back again; 'God save you,' says he, 'King O'Toole.' "'Thrue for you,' says the king, 'I am King O'Toole,' says he, 'prince and plennypennytinchery o' these parts,' says he; 'but how kem ye to know that?' says he. ." 'Oh, never mind,' says Saint Kavin. "For you see," said Old Joe, in his undertone again, and looking very knowingly, "it  "'And who are you?' said the king, 'that makes so bowld--who are you, at all at all?' "Oh, never you mind,' says Saint Kavin, 'who I am; you'll know more o' me before we part, King O'Toole,' says he. "'I'll be proud o' the knowledge o' your acqaintance, sir,' says the king mighty p'lite. "'Troth, you may say that,' says Saint Kavin. 'And now, may I make bowld to ax, how is your goose, King O'Toole?' says he. "'Blur-an-agers, how kem you to know about my goose?' says the king. "'Oh, no matther; I was given to undherstand It,' says Saint Kavin. "'Oh, that's a folly to talk,' says the king; 'bekase myself and my goose Is private frinds,' says he, 'and no one could tell you,' says he 'barrin' the fairies.' "'Oh, thin, it wasn't the fairies,' says Saint Kavin; 'for I'd have you to know,' says he, "that I don't keep the likes o' sitch company.' "You might do worse then, my gay fellow,' says the king; 'for it's  "'Maybe I've a betther way of making money rnyself' says the saint. "'By gor,' says the king, 'barrin' you're a coiner," says he, 'that's impossible!' "I'd scorn to be the like, my lord!' says Saint Kavin, mighty high, 'I'd scorn to be the like,' says he. "'Then, what are you,' says the king 'that makes money so aisy, by your own account? ' "'I'm an honest man,' says Saint Kavin. "'Well, honest man,' says the king, 'and how is it you make your money so aisy?' "'By makin' ould things as good as new,' says Saint Kavin. "'Blur-an-ouns, is it a tinker you are?' says the king. "'No,' say. the saint; 'I'm no tinker by thrade, King O'Toole; I've a betther thade than a tinker,' says he--' what would you say,' says he, 'if I made your old goose as good as new?' "My dear, at the word o' makin' his goose as good as new, you'd think the poor ould king's eyes was ready to jump out iv his head, 'and,' says he--'troth, thin, I'd give you more money nor you could count,' says he, 'if you did the like; and I'd be behoulden to you into the bargain.' "'I scorn your dirty money,' .sys Saint Kavin. "'Faith then, l'm thinkln' a thrifle o' change would do you no harm,' says the king, lookin' up sly at the old  "'I have a vow agin' it,' says the saint; 'and I am "'Barrin' the thrifle you can't help,' says the king, mighty cute, and looking him straight in the face. "'You just hot it,' says Saint Kavin; 'but though I can't take money,' says he, 'I could take a few acres o' land, if you'd give them to me." "'With all the veins o' my heart,' says the king, 'If you can do what you say.' "'Thry me!' says Saint Kavin. 'Call down your goose here,' says he, 'and I'll see what I can do for her.' "'With that the king whistled "' "'Oh, by dad,' says Saint Kavin, "you must say more nor that - my horn's not so soft all out,' says he, 'as to repair your ould goose for nothing '; what'll you gi' me, if I do the job for you?--that's the chat,' says Saint Kavin. "'I'll give you whatever you ax,' says the king; 'isn't that fair?' "'Divil a fairer,' says the saint; 'that's the way to do business. Now,' says he, 'this is the bargain I'll make with you, King O'Toole: will you gi' me all the ground the goose flies, over the first offer afther I make her as good as new?' "'I will,' says the king. "'You won't go back o' your word?' says Saint Kavin. "'Honour bright!' says King O'Toole, howldin' out his fist." Here old Joe, after applying his hand to his mouth, and making a sharp, blowing sound (something like " "'Honour bright,' says Saint Kavin back agin, 'it's a bargain,' says he. 'Come here!' says he to the poor ould goose--'come here, you unfort'nate ould cripple,' says he, 'and it's  "With that, my dear, he tuk up the goose by the two wings--'Criss o' my crass and you,' says he, markin' her to grace with the blessed sign at the same minute--and throwin' her up in the air, 'whew!' says he, jist givin' her a blast to help her; and with that, my jewel, she tuk, to her heels, flyin' like one o' the aigles themselves, and cuttin' as many capers as a swallow before a shower of rain.

"'By gor,' says the king, 'I say nothin' bates the art o' man, barrin' the bees.' "'And do you say no more nor that?, says Saint Kavin. "'And that I'm behoulden to you,' says the king. "'But will you gi'e me all the ground the goose flewn over?' says Saint Kavin. "'I will,' says King O'TooIe. 'And you're welkim to it,' says he, 'though it's the last acre I have to give.' "'But you'll keep your word thrue' says the saint. "'As thrue as the sun,' says the king. "'It's well for you,' says Saint Kavin, mighty sharp--' it's well for you, King O'Toole, that you said that word,' says he; 'for if you didn't say that word, the  "Oh! you needn't laugh," said old Joe, half offended at detecting the trace of a suppressed smile; "you needn't laugh,  "Well, whin the king was as good as his word, Saint Kavin was  "'Troth, then, you're right enough,' says the king. 'I didn't perceave it,' says he; 'for, indeed, I never seen the sign o' aper'ts an you.' "'Oh! that's not what I mane,' says Saint Kavin. 'I mane I'm deceavin' you all out, and that I'm not myself at all.' "'Blur-an-agers! thin,' says the king, 'if you're not yourself, who are you?' "'I'm Saint Kavin,' said the saint, bleesin' himself. "'Oh, queen iv heaven!" says the king, makin' the sign o' the crass betune his eyes, and fallin' down on his knees before the saint. 'Is it the great Saint Kavin,' says he, 'that I've been discoorsin' all this time without knowin' it,' says he, 'all as one as if he was a lump iv a  "'I am,' says Saint Kavin. "'By gor, I thought I was only talking to a decent boy,' says the king. "'Well, you know the differ now,' says the saint. 'I'm Saint Kavin,' says he, 'the greatest of all the saints.' "For Saint Kavin, you must know, sir," added Joe, treating me to another parenthesis, "Saint Kavin is counted the greatest of all the saints, bekase he went to school with the prophet Jeremiah. "Well, my dear, that's the way that the place kem, all at wanst, into the hands of Saint Kavin; for the goose flewn round every individyial acre o' King O' Toole's property, you see,  "Howsumdever, the king never recovered the loss iv his goose, though he had her stuffed (I don't mane stuffed with pratees and inyans, but as a curosity) and preserved in a glass case
