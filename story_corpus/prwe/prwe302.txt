WEATHER AT LISKEARD.
 Â  "THE south wind always brings wet weather; The north wind, wet and cold together.
The west wind always brings us rain; The east wind blows it back again.
If the sun in red should set, The next day surely will be wet If the sun should set in gray, The next will be a rainy day."
Bond's Looe.
