WHISTLING
 Â TO whistle by night is one of the unpardonable sins amongst the fishermen of St Ives.
My correspondent says, "I would no more dare go among a party of fishermen at night whistling a popular air than into a den of untamed tigers.
"No miner will allow of whistling underground.
I could never learn from the miners whether they regarded it as unlucky or not.
I rather think they feel that whistling indicates thoughtlessness, and they know their labour is one of danger, requiring serious attention.
