CELTS--FLINT ARROW-HEADS, ETC.
 Â THE common people believe these to be produced by thunder, and thrown down from the clouds, and that they show what weather will ensue by changing their colour.
I have also found a belief prevailing in many districts, that Celts impart a virtue to water in which they have been soaked, and that diseases have been cured by drinking it.
