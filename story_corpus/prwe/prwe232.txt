"ST GEORGE"--THE CHRISTMAS PLAYS.
THE Christmas play is a very ancient institution in Cornwall.
At one time religious subjects were chosen, but those gave way to romantic plays.
The arrangements were tolerably complete, and sometimes a considerable amount of dramatic skill was displayed.
"St George, and the other tragic performers, are dressed out some.
what in the style of morris-dancers, in their shirt sleeves and white trousers, much decorated with riblbons and handkerchiefs, each carryg a drawn sword in his hand, if they can be procured, otherwise a cudgel.
They wear high caps of pasteboard, adorned with beads, small pieces of looking-glass, coloured paper, &c. ; several long strips of pith generally hang down from the top, with small pieces of different coloured cloth strung on them; the whole has a very smart effect.Father Christmas is personified in a grotesque manner, as an ancient man wearing a large mask and wig, and a huge club, wherewith he keeps the bystanders in order.The Doctor, who is generally the merryandrew of the piece, is dressed in any ridiculous way, with a wig, three-cornered hat, and painted face.The other comic characters are dressed according to fancy.
The female, where there is one, is usually in the dress worn half a century ago.The hobbyhorse, which is a character sometimes introduced, wears a representation of a horse's hide.Beside the regular drama of "St George," many parties of mummers go about in fancy dresses of every sort, most commonly the males in female attire, and vice versa.BATTLE OF ST GEORGE
