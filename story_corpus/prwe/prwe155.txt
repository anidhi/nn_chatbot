REDRUTH WELL.
NO child christened in this well has ever been hanged.
Saint Ruth, said to have been called Red Ruth, because she always wore a scarlet cloak, especially blessed, to this extent, those waters.
I believe the population in this large parish cares but little now whether their children be baptized with this well water or any other; but, half a century since, it was very different.
Then, many a parent would insist on seeing the water taken from the well and carried to the font in the church.
