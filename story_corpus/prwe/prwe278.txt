RAIN AT BRIDAL OR BURIAL.
 Â "BLESSED is the brideWhom the sun shines on,Blessed is the deadWhom the rain rains on.
"If it rains while a wedding party are on their way to the church, or on returning from it, it betokens a life of bickering and unhappiness.If the rain falls on a coffin, it is supposed to indicate that the soul of the departed has "arrived safe."
