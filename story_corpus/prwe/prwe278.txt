RAIN AT BRIDAL OR BURIAL.
 Â  "BLESSED is the bride Whom the sun shines on, Blessed is the dead Whom the rain rains on."
If it rains while a wedding party are on their way to the church, or on returning from it, it betokens a life of bickering and unhappiness.
If the rain falls on a coffin, it is supposed to indicate that the soul of the departed has "arrived safe."
