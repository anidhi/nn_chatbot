 THE FAIRY'S SONG. 2

 "O where is tiny Hew?
And where is little Len?
And where is bonnie Lu,   And Menie of the Glen ?
And where's the place of rest--   The ever changing hame ?
Is it the gowan's breast,   Or 'neath the bells of faem?
Ay lu lan dil y'u.
"The fairest rose you find   May have a taint within; The flower of womankind   May not be free from sin,-- The fox-glove cup go bring,   The tail of shooting sterne, p. 151 And round our grassy ring   We'll pledge the pith o' fern.
Ay lu lan dil y'u.
"And when the yellow moon   Is gliding down the sky, On wings of wishes boun',   Our band to her can fly; Her highest horn we'll ride,   And quaff her honey dew; Then in her shadowy side   Our gambollings renew!
Ay lu lan dil y'u.
