<p>"Noo, lasses, ye should never be owre proud; for ye see there was ance a leddy, and she was aye fond o' being brawer than other folk; so she gaed awa' to take a walk ae day, her and her brother: so she met wi' a gentleman--but it was nae gentleman in reality, but Auld Nick himsel', who can change himsel' brawly into a gentleman--a' but the cloven feet; but he keepit them out o' sight. So he began to make love to the young leddy:--</p>  
<p>'I'll gie you a pennyworth o' preens, <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">3</font></a><br> That's aye the way that love begins;<br> If ye'll walk with me, leddy, leddy,<br> If ye'll walk with me, leddy.'</p>

<p>'I'll no hae your pennyworth o' preens,<br> That's no the way that love begins;<br> And I'll no walk with you, with you,<br> And I'll no walk with you.'</p>  
<p>'O Johnie, O Johnie, what can the matter be,<br> That I love this leddy, and she loves na me?<br> And for her sake I must die, must die,<br> And for her sake I must die!</p>  
<p>'I'll gie you a bonny silver box,<br> With seven silver hinges, and seven silver locks,<br> If ye'll walk,' etc.</p>  
<p>'I'll no hae your bonny silver box,<br> With seven silver hinges, and seven silver locks,<br> And I'll no walk,' etc.</p>  
<p>'O Johnie, O Johnie' [<i>as in third verse</i>].</p>  
<p>'But I'll gie you a bonnier silver box,<br> With seven golden hinges, and seven golden locks,<br> If ye'll walk,' etc.</p>

<p>'O Johnie' [<i>as in third verse</i>].</p>  
<p>'I'll gie you a pair o' bonny shoon,<br> The tane made in Sodom, the tother in Rome,<br> If ye'll walk,' etc.</p>
