 THE BROWNIE OF BODSBECK.Â 1

Tim brownie of the farmhouse of Bodsbeek, in Moffatdale, left his employment upwards of a century ago, on a similar account.
He had exerted himself so much in the f arm labour, both in and out of   doors, that Bodsbeek became the most prosperous farm in the district.
He always took his meat as it pleased himself, usually in very moderate quantities, and of the most humble description.
During a time of very hard labour, perhaps harvest, when a little better fare than ordinary might have been judged acceptable, the goodman took the liberty of leaving out a mess of bread and milk, thinking it but fair that at a time when some improvement, both in quantity and quality, was made upon the fare of the human servants, the useful brownie should obtain a share in the blessing.
He, however, found his error, for the result was that the brownie left the house for ever, exclaiming-- "Ca', brownie, ca' A' the luck o' Bodsbeck away to Leithenha'."
The luck of Bodsbeek accordingly departed with its brownie, and settled in the neighbouring farmhouse, called Leithenhall, whither the brownie transferred his friendship and services.
