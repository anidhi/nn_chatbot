 THE FAIRY AND THE BIBLE-READER.Â 1

ON a still Sabbath evening in summer, an old man was seated, reading his Bible in the open air, at a quiet spot upon the Ross-shire coast.
A beautiful little lady, clad in green, drew near, and addressing him in a silvery voice, sought to know if for such as she Holy Scripture held out any hope of salvation.
The old man spoke kindly to her; but said that in those pages there was no mention of salvation for any but the sinful sons of Adam.
On hearing this, the fairy flung her arms despairingly above her head, and with a shriek plunged into the sea.
