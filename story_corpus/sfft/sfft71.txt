 LAIRD HARRY GILLES.Â 1

THE Laird Harry Gilles of Littledean was extremely fond of hunting.
One day, as his dogs were chasing a hare, they suddenly stopped, and gave up the pursuit, which enraged him so much that he swore the animal they had been hunting must be one of the witches of Maxton.
No sooner had he uttered the word than hares appeared all round him, so close that they even sprang over the saddle before his eyes, but still none of his hounds would give them chase.
In a fit of anger he jumped off his horse and killed the dogs on the spot, all but one black hound, who at that moment turned to pursue the largest hare.
Remounting his horse, he followed the chase, and saw the black hound turn the hare and drive it directly towards him.
The hare made a spring as if to clear his horse's neck, but the laird dexterously caught hold of one of her fore-paws, drew out his hunting-knife, and cut it off; after which the hares, which had been so numerous, all disappeared.
Next morning Laird Harry heard that a woman of Maxton had lost her arm in some unaccountable manner; so he went straight to her house, pulled out the hare's foot (which had changed in his pocket to a woman's hand and arm), and applied it to the stump.
It fitted exactly.
She confessed her crime, and was drowned for witchcraft the same day in the well, by the young men of Maxton.
