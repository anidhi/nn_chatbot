 THE BEE AND THE MOUSE.
A BEE met a mouse and said-- "Come over till we, make a house."
"I will not," said Luchag, the mousie.
"He to whom thou gavest thy summer honey, Let him make a winter house for thee; I have a little house under the ground, p. 98 That can reach neither cold nor breeze, Thou wilt be a ragged creature, Running on the tops of the trees."
