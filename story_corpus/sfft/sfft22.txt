 THE EAGLE AND THE WREN.Â 1

THE Eagle and the Wren once tried who could fly highest, and the victor was to be king of the birds.
So the Wren flew straight up, and the Eagle flew in great circles, and when the Wren was tired he settled on the Eagle's back.
When the Eagle was tired he stopped, and--"Where art thou, Wren?"
said the Eagle.
"I am here above thee," said the Wren.And so the Wren won the match.
