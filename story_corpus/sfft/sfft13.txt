STORIES OF ANIMALS. 1
 THE FOX OUTWITTED.
ONE day the fox succeeded in catching a fine fat goose asleep by the side of a loch; he held her by the wing, and making a joke of her cackling, hissing, and fears, he said--"Now, if you had me in your mouth as I have you, tell me what you would do?
""Why," said the goose, "that is an easy question.
I would fold my hands, shut my eyes, say a grace, and then eat you.
""Just what I mean to do," said Rory; 2 and folding his hands, and looking very demure, he said a pious grace with his eyes shut.But while he did this the goose had spread her wings, and she was now half way over the loch; so the fox was left to lick his lips for supper.
"I will make a rule of this," he said in disgust, never in all my life to say a grace again till after I feel the meat warm in my belly."
