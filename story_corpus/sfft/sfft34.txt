 THE ISLE OF PABAIDH.Â 2

THERE came a woman of peace (a fairy) the way of the house of a man in the island of Pabaidh, and   she had the hunger of motherhood on her.
He gave her food, and that went well with her.
She stayed that night.
When she went away she said to him, "I am making a desire that none of the people of this island may go in childbed after this."
None of these people, and none others that would make their dwelling in the island, ever departed in childbed from that time.
