Jewish Fairy Tales and Legends: The Red Slipper
Rosy-red was a sweet little girl, with beautiful blue eyes, soft pink cheeks and glorious ruddy-gold hair of the tinge that artists love to paint.
Her mother died the day she was born, but her grandmother looked after her with such tender care that Rosy-red regarded her as her mother.
She was very happy, was Rosy-red.
All day long she sang, as she tripped gaily about the house or the woods that surrounded it, and so melodious was her voice that the birds gathered on the trees to listen to her and to encourage her to continue, by daintily chirruping whenever she ceased.
Merrily Rosy-red performed all the little duties her grandmother called upon her to do, and on festivals she was allowed to wear a delightful pair of red leather slippers, her father's gift to her on her first birthday.
Now, although neither she nor her father knew it, they were magic slippers which grew larger as her feet grew.
