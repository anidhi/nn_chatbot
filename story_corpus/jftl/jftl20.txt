Jewish Fairy Tales and Legends: King for Three Days
    Godfrey de Bouillon was a famous warrior, a daring general and bold leader of men, who gained victories in several countries.
And so, in the year 1095, when the first Crusade came to be arranged, he was entrusted with the command of one of the armies and led it across Europe in the historic march to the Holy Land.
Like many a great soldier of his period, Godfrey was a cruel man, and, above all, he hated the Jews.

He was becoming an old man then, but he was as brave as the swaggering soldier, and he faced Godfrey unflinchingly.
"I can make no claim on the God of Israel on behalf of one who has sworn to destroy all the descendants of His chosen people," he said.
"So, ho!"
exclaimed Godfrey, "you defy me.'
But he stopped his angry words abruptly,
