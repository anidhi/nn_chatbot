The Blue Fairy Book: Rumpelstiltzkin
There was once upon a time a poor miller who had a very beautiful daughter.
 Now it happened one day that he had an audience with the King, and in order to appear a person of some importance he told him that he had a daughter who could spin straw into gold.
 Now thats a talent worth having, said the King to the miller; if your daughter is as clever as you say, bring her to my palace to-morrow, and Ill put her to the test.
 When the girl was brought to him he led her into a room full of straw, gave her a spinning-wheel and spindle, and said: Now set to work and spin all night till early dawn, and if by that time you havent spun the straw into gold you shall die.
 Then he closed the door behind him and left her alone inside.
 So the poor millers daughter sat down, and didnt know what in the world she was to do.
 She hadnt the least idea of how to spin straw into gold, and became at last so miserable that she began to cry.
 Suddenly the door opened, and in stepped a tiny little man and said: Good-evening, Miss Miller-maid; why are you crying so bitterly?
 Oh!
 answered the girl, I have to spin straw into gold, and havent a notion how its done.
 What will you give me if I spin it for you?
 asked the manikin.
 My necklace, replied the girl.
 The little man took the necklace, sat himself down at the wheel, and whir, whir, whir, the wheel went round three times, and the bobbin was full.
 Then he put on another, and whir, whir, whir, the wheel went round three times, and the second too was full; and so it went on till the morning, when all the straw was spun away, and all the bobbins were full of gold.
 As soon as the sun rose the King came, and when he perceived the gold he was astonished and delighted, but his heart only lusted more than ever after the precious metal.
 He had the millers daughter put into another room full of straw, much bigger than the first, and bade her, if she valued her life, spin it all into gold before the following morning.
 The girl didnt know what to do, and began to cry; then the door opened as before, and the tiny little man appeared and said: Whatll you give me if I spin the straw into gold for you?
 The ring from my finger, answered the girl.
 The manikin took the ring, and whir!
 round went the spinning-wheel again, and when morning broke he had spun all the straw into glittering gold.
 The King was pleased beyond measure at the sights but his greed for gold was still not satisfied, and he had the millers daughter brought into a yet bigger room full of straw, and said: You must spin all this away in the night; but if you succeed this time you shall become my wife.
 Shes only a millers daughter, its true, he thought; but I couldnt find a richer wife if I were to search the whole world over.
 When the girl was alone the little man appeared for the third time, and said: Whatll you give me if I spin the straw for you once again?
 Ive nothing more to give, answered the girl.
 Then promise me when you are Queen to give me your first child.
 Who knows what may not happen before that?
 thought the millers daughter; and besides, she saw no other way out of it, so she promised the manikin what he demanded, and he set to work once more and spun the straw into gold.
 When the King came in the morning, and found everything as he had desired, he straightway made her his wife, and the millers daughter became a queen.
 Then the Queen pondered the whole night over all the names she had ever heard, and sent a messenger to scour the land, and to pick up far and near any names he could come across.
 When the little man arrived on the following day she began with Kasper, Melchior, Belshazzar, and all the other names she knew, in a string, but at each one the manikin called out: Thats not my name.
 The next day she sent to inquire the names of all the people in the neighborhood, and had a long list of the most uncommon and extraordinary for the little man when he made his appearance.
 Is your name, perhaps, Sheepshanks Cruickshanks, Spindleshanks?
 but he always replied: Thats not my name.
 On the third day the messenger returned and announced: I have not been able to find any new names, but as I came upon a high hill round the corner of the wood, where the foxes and hares bid each other good-night, I saw a little house, and in front of the house burned a fire, and round the fire sprang the most grotesque little man, hopping on one leg and crying: To-morrow I brew, to-day I bake,
