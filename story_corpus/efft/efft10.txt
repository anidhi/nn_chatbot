THE LEGEND OF THE SONS OF THE CONQUEROR. Â 1

This story, which most probably is of Eastern origin, is frequently told under various circumstances by medieval writers.
A Latin manuscript, of the thirteenth century, relates it in the following form:-- A wealthy English baron, whose broad lands extended over a large extent of England and Wales, had three sons; when lying on his death-bed he called them to him, and said: "If you were compelled to become birds, tell me what bird each of you would choose to resemble?"
The eldest said: "I would be a hawk, because it is a noble bird, and lives by rapine."
The second said: "I would be a starling, because it is a social bird, and flies in coveys."
The youngest said: "I would be a swan, because it has a long neck, so that if I had anything in my heart to say, I should have plenty of time for reflection before it came to my mouth."
When the father had heard them, he said to the first: "Thou, my son, as I perceive, desirest to live by rapine; I will therefore bequeath thee my possessions in England, because it is a land of peace and justice, and thou canst not rob in it with impunity."
To the second he said: "Because thou lovest society, I will bequeath thee my lands in Wales, which is a land of discord and war, in order that thy courtesy may soften down the malice of the natives."
And then turning to the youngest, he said: "To thee I bequeath no land at all, because thou art wise, and wilt gain enough by thy wisdom."
And as he foretold, the youngest son profited by his wisdom, and became Lord Chief-Justice of England, which in those times was the next dignity to that of king.
