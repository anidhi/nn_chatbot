THE HEDLEY KOW. Â 1

Two adventures with the Hedley Kow are thus related.
A farmer named Forster, who lived near Hedley, went out into the field one morning, and caught, as he believed, his own grey horse.
After putting the harness on, and yoking him to the cart, Forster was about to drive off, when the creature slipped away from the limmers "like a knotless thread," and set up a great nicker as he flung up his heels and scoured away, revealing himself clearly as the Hedley Kow.
Again, two young men of Newlands, near Ebchester, went out one evening to meet their sweethearts; and arriving at the trysting-place, saw them, as it appeared, a short distance before them.
The girls walked on for two or three miles; the lads followed, quite unable to overtake them, till at last they found themselves up to the knees in a bog, and their beguilers vanished, with a loud Ha!
ha!
The young men got clear of the mire and ran homewards, as fast as they could, the bogie at their heels hooting and mocking them.
In crossing the Derwent they fell into the water, mistook each other for the sprite, and finally reached home separately, each telling a fearful tale of having been chased by the Hedley Kow, and nearly drowned in the Derwent.
Surely this Northern sprite is closely akin to Robin Good-fellow, whom Ben Jonson introduced to us as speaking thus: "Sometimes I meete them like a man, Sometimes an ox, sometimes a hound, And to a horse I turn me can, To trip and trot about them round.
But if to ride My backe they stride, More swift than wind away I go: O'er the hedge and lands,  Through pools and ponds, I whirry laughing, Ho ho ho!"
