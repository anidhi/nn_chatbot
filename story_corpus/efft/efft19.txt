FAIRIES.
It also is said that upon another occasion a fairy came to a ploughman in the same field, and exclaimed:"Oh, lend a hammer and a nail, Which we want to mend our pail"There likewise is a saying in the neighbourhood, that if a woman should break her peel (a kind of shovel used in baking bread), and should leave it for a little while at the fairies' cave in Osebury Rock, it would be mended for her.
