KENTSHAM BELL Â 1

Then the people went to the cunning man and asked him what they should do.
And he said: "Take six yoke of white milch-kine which have never borne the yoke, and take fresh withy bands which have never been used before, and let no man speak a word either good or bad till the bell is at the top of the hill.
"So they took six yoke of white milch-kine which had never borne the yoke, and harnessed them with fresh withy-bands which had never been used, and bound these to the bell as it lay in the shallow water, and long it was ere they could move it.
But still the kine struggled and pulled, and the withy-bands held firm, and at last the bell was on dry ground.
Slowly, slowly they drew it up the hill, moaning and groaning with unearthly sounds as it went; slowly, slowly, and no one spoke, and they nearly reached the top of the hill.
Now the captain had been wild with grief when be saw that he had caused his precious freight to be lost in the waters just as they had reached the shore; and when he beheld it recovered again and so nearly placed in safety, he could not contain his joy, but sang out merrily:"In spite of all the devils in hell, We have got to land old Kentsham Bell.
"Instantly the withy-bands broke in the midst, and the bell bounded back again down the sloping hillside, rolling over and over, faster and faster, with unearthly clanging, till it sank far away in the very depths of the sea.
And no man has ever seen it since, but many have heard it tolling beneath the waves, and if you go there you may hear it too.
