THE BLINDED GIANT. Â 1

The day was hot, and after dinner the giant lay down in the mill with his head on a sack and dozed.
He had been eating in the mill, and had laid down a great loaf of bone bread by his side, and the knife was in his hand, but his fingers relaxed their hold of it in sleep.
Jack seized the moment, drew the knife away, and holding it with both his hands drove the blade into the single eye of the giant, who woke with a howl of agony, and starting up barred the door.
Jack was again in difficulties, but he soon found a way out of them.
The giant had a favourite dog, which had also been sleeping when his master was blinded.
Jack killed the dog, skinned it, and throwing the hide over his back ran on all-fours barking between the legs of the giant, and so escaped.
