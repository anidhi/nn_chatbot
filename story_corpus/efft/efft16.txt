BOMERE POOL. Â 1

The rains fell that December in immense quantities.
The mere was swollen beyond its usual limits, and all the hollows in the hills were filled to overflowing.
One day when the old priest was on the hill-side gathering fuel he noticed that the barrier of peat, earth, and stones, which prevented the mere from flowing into the valley, was apparently giving way before the mass of water above.
He hurried down to the village and besought the men to come up and cut a channel for the discharge of the superfluous waters of the mere.
They only greeted his proposal with shouts of derision, and told him to go and mind his prayers, and not spoil their feast with his croaking and his kill-joy presence.
These heathen were then keeping their winter festival with great revelry.
It fell on Christmas Eve.
The same night the aged priest summoned his few faithful ones to attend at the midnight mass, which ushered in the feast of our Saviour's Nativity.
The night was stormy, and the rain fell in torrents, yet this did not prevent the little flock from coming to the chapel.
The old servant of God had already begun the holy sacrifice, when a roar was heard in the upper part of the valley.
The server was just ringing the Sanctus bell which hung in the bell-cot, when a flood of water dashed into the church, and rapidly rose till it put out the altarlights.
In a few moments more the whole building was washed away, and the mere, which had burst its mountain barrier, occupied the hollow in which the village had stood.
Men say that if you sail over the mere on Christmas Eve, just after midnight, you may hear the Sanctus bell tolling.
