WILD EDRIC. Â 1

He pledged himself by all that was most sacred to be ever faithful and constant in his love for her, and they were solemnly wedded in the presence of all the nobles from far and near, whom Edric invited to their bridal feast.
At that time William the Norman was newly made king of England, who, hearing of this wonder, desired both to see the lady, and to test the truth of the tale; and bade the newly-married pair to London, where he was holding his Court.
Thither then they went, and many witnesses from their own country with them, who brought with them the testimony of others who could not present themselves to the king.
But the marvellous beauty of the lady was the best of all proofs of her superhuman origin.
And the king let them return in peace, wondering greatly.Many years passed happily by, till one evening Edric returned late from hunting, and could not find his wife.
He sought her and called for her for some time in vain.
At last she appeared.
"I suppose," began he, with angry looks, "it is your sisters who have detained you such a long time, have they not?"
The rest of his upbraiding was addressed to the air, for the moment her sisters were mentioned she vanished.
Edric's grief was overwhelming.
He sought the place where he had found her at first, but no tears, no laments of his could call her back.
He cried out day and night against his own folly, and pined away and died of sorrow, as his wife had long before foretold.
