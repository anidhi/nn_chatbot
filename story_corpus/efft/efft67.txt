DROLLS.
The words of an humble poet may be here applicable--"Tell me no more of Gotham fools, Or of their eels in little pools, Which they were told were drowning; Nor of their carts drawn up on high, When King John's men were standing by, To keep a wood from browning."Nor of their cheese shoved down the hill, Nor of a cuckoo sitting still, While it they hedged round; Such tales of them have long been told, By prating boobies, young and old, In drunken circles crowned."The fools are those who thither go To see the cuckoo bush, I trow, The wood, the barn, and pools; For such are seen both here and there, And passed by without a sneer By all but errant fools" Â
