Old Mother Wiggle-Waggle
The fox and his wife they had a great strife, The fox went out, one still, clear night, The fox when he came to yonder stile, And first he arrived at a farmer's yard, The fox when he came to the farmer's gate, The grey goose she ran round the hay-stack, Then he took the grey goose by her sleeve, And he seized the black duck by the neck, Old Mother Wiggle-Waggle hopped out of bed, Then the old man got up in his red cap, When he got to the top of the hill, But at last he arrived at his home again, So he sat down together with his hungry wife,
