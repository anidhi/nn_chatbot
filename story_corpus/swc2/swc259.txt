Traditions and Hearthside Stories of West Cornwall, Vol. 2, by William Bottrell, [1873], at sacred-texts.com
The following story, told me by an aged mine captain, of Lelant, will serve to explain it.A few years ago a smuggler of Breage gave false evidence, which caused one of another crew to he hanged, on the charge of having fired a fatal shot at an officer belonging to a revenue cutter.This perjurer, who swore away an innocent man's life, received —for informing—such a sum of blood money as made him comparatively rich, yet he remained at sea for several years, until he came to live at Hayle.
Few persons there knew him; but everybody remarked that he looked deathly pale and shivered with cold, however warm the weather might be.
lie lived alone and rarely left his house to go beyond his garden, and his neighbours said that when he stood out in "sunshiney" weather he cast no shadow.
They surmised that he had been forsworn; for he could never see the sun, and the sky always appeared dark to him; yet he saw everything else the same as other people.After his decease it became known how he had caused an innocent man's death.
