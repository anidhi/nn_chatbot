Jewish Fairy Tales and Legends: The Fairy Frog
Once upon a time there lived a man of learning and wealth who had an only son, named Hanina.
To this son, who was grown up and married, he sent a messenger asking that he should immediately come to his father.
Hanina obeyed, and found both his father and mother lying ill. "Know, my son," said the old man, "we are about to die.
Grieve not, for it has been so ordained.
We have been companions through life, and we are to be privileged to leave this world together.
You will mourn for us the customary seven days.
They will end on the eve of the festival of the Passover.
On that day go forth into the market place and purchase the first thing offered to thee, no matter what it is, or what the cost that may be demanded.
It will in due course bring thee good fortune.
Hearken unto my words, my son, and all will be well."
    Hanina promised obedience to this strange injunction of his father, and events fell out in accordance with the old man's prediction.
The aged couple died on the same day, were buried together and after the week of mourning, on the day preceding the Passover festival, Hanina made his way to the market place wondering what adventure was in store for him.
He had scarcely entered the market place, where all manner of wares were displayed, when an old man approached him, carrying a silver casket of curious design.
"Purchase this, my son," he said, "and it will bring thee good fortune."
"What does it contain?"
asked Hanina.
"That I may not inform thee," was the reply.
"Indeed I cannot, for I know not.
Only the purchaser can open it at the feast which begins the Passover."
Naturally, Hanina was impressed by these words.
Matters were shaping just as his father foretold.
"What is the price?"
he asked.
"A thousand gold pieces."
That was an enormous sum, nearly the whole that he possessed, but Hanina, remembering his vow, paid the money and took the casket home.
