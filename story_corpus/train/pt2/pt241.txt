XLIX.
THUIRT an luch bheag 's i 'san toll, "Dé 'm fonn a th' air a' chat ghlas?"
"Fonn math is deagh shaod Gum faodadh thusa tighinn a mach."
"S mor m' eagal romh na dubhain chrom, A th' agad ann am bonn do chas Mharbh thu mo phiuthrag an dé 'S fhuair mi fein air eigin as."
Cha mhis' a bha 'sin ach cat mhic Iain Ruaigh A b' àbhaist a bhi ruagadh chearc, Ghoid i 'n caise 'bha 's a' chliabh, 'S dh'ith i 'n t-iasg a bha 's a' phreas."
Said the mousie in the hole, "What is that purr of the grey cat?"
"A good purr and a pleasant mood, That thou mightest come out of that."
"Great is my fear for the crooked hooks That thou hast got in the sole of thy feet; Thou killedst my sister yesterday, And I myself got hardly quit."
"That was not me, but John Roy's cat, That used to be the hen's distress: She stole the cheese that was in the creel, And ate the fish that was in the press."
This old rhyme has become proverbial.
A part of it was sent as a proverb from Inverary.
