THE MONTH OF MAY UNLUCKY
 Â MAY is regarded by many as an unhealthy and unlucky month.
Children born in the month of May are called "May chets," and kittens cast in May are invariably destroyed, for--  " May chets Bad luck begets."
Another rhyme is-- "A hot May, Fat church hay," meaning that funerals will be plenty.
