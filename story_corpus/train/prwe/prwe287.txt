THE SPARK ON THE CANDLE.
 Â A BRIGHT spark on the candle-wick indicates a letter coming to the house.
The person towards whom it shines will receive it.
The time of its arrival is determined by striking the bottom of the candlestick on the table.
If the spark comes off on the first blow, it will be received to-morrow; if two blows are required, on the second day,--and so on.
