The Old Crow 
  THERE was an old crow teaching a young crow one day, and he said to him, Now my son, says he, listen to the advice Im going to give you.
If you see a person coming near you and stooping, mind yourself, and be on your keeping; hes stooping for a stone to throw at you. But tell me, says the young crow, what should I do if he had a stone already down in his pocket?
 Musha, go long out of that, says the old crow, youve learned enough; the devil another learning Im able to give you.
