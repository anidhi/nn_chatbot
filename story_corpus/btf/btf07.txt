The Alp-Luachra
  THERE was once a wealthy farmer in Connacht, and he had plenty of substance and a fine family, and there was nothing putting grief nor trouble on him, and you would say yourself that its he was the comfortable, satisfied man, and that the luck was on him as well as on eer a man alive.
He was that way, When he awoke then, he sat up, and he did not know at first where he was, till he remembered at last that it was in the field at the back of his own house he was lying.
He rose up then and returned to his house, and he felt like a pain or a stitch in his side.
He made nothing of it, sat down at the fire and began warming himself.
Where were you?
 says the daughter to him.
I was asleep a while, says he, on the fresh grass in the field where they were making hay. What happened to you, then?
 says she, for you dont look well. Muirya,* musha, then, says he, I dont know; but its queer the feeling I have.
I never was like it before; but Ill be better when I get a good sleep. He went to his bed, lay down, and fell asleep, and never awoke until the sun was high.
He rose up then and his wife said to him: What was on you that you slept that long?
 I dont know, says he.
He went down to the fire where the daughter was making a cake for the breakfast, and she said to him: How are you, to-day, father; are you anything better?
 I got a good sleep, said he, but Im not a taste better than I was last night; and indeed, if youd believe me, I think theres something inside of me running back and forwards. Arrah, that cant be, says the daughter, but its a cold you got and you lying out on the fresh grass; and if youre not better in the evening well send for the doctor.
