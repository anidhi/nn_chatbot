XLI.
THERE was formerly a poor widow, and she had three daughters, and all she had to feed them was a kailyard.
There was a great gray horse who was coming every day to the yard to eat the kail.
Said the eldest of the daughters to her mother, "I will go to the yard to-day, and I will take the spinning-wheel with me, and I will keep the horse out of the kail."
"Do," said her mother.
She went out.
The horse came; she took the distaff from the wheel and she struck him.
The distaff stuck to the horse, and her hand stuck to the distaff.
Away went the horse till, they reached a green hill, and he called out, "Open, open, oh green hill, and let in the king's son; open, open, oh green hill, and let in the widow's daughter."
The hill opened, and they went in.
He warmed water for her feet, and made a soft bed for her limbs, and she lay down that night.
Early on the morrow, when he rose, he was going to hunt.
He gave her the keys of the whole house, and he said to her that she might open every chamber inside but the one.
"By all she ever saw not to open that one."
That she should have his dinner ready when he should come back, and that if she would be a good woman that he would marry her.
When he went away she began to open the chambers.
