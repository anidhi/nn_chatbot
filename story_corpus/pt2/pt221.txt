X.
THE Feen were once, and their hunting failed, and they did not know what they should do.
They were going about strands and shores gathering limpets, and to try if they should fall in with a pigeon or a plover.
They were holding counsel together how they should go to get game.
They reached a hill, and sleep came on them.
What should Fionn see but a dream.
That it was at yon crag of rock that be would be, the longest night that came or will come; that he would be driven backwards till he should set his back to the crag of rock.
He gave a spring out of his sleep.
He struck his foot on Diarmid's mouth, and he drove out three of his teeth.
Diarmid caught hold of the foot of Fionn, and he drove an ounce of blood from every nail he had.
"Ud!
what didst thou to me?"
--"What didst thou thyself to me?"
--"Be not angry, thou son of my sister.
When I tell thee the reason, thou wilt not take it ill."--"What reason?"
--"I saw a dream that at yonder crag I would pass the hardest night I ever passed; that I should be driven backwards till I should set my back to the crag, and there was no getting off from there."
"What's our fear!
Who should frighten us!
Who will come!"
"I fear, as we are in straits just now, that if this lasts we may become useless."
They went and they cast lots who should go and who should stay.
