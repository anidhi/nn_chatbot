L.
THERE was once, long ago, a scholar; and when he had done learning, his master said that he must now answer three questions, or have his head taken off.
The scholar was to have time to make ready, and being in a great fright, he went to a miller who was the master's brother, and asked his aid.
The miller disguised himself and went instead of the scholar, and the first question put to him was this:--"How many ladders would reach the sky?"
"Now," said the narrator, "can you answer that?"
"One, if it were long enough."
"That's right."
The second was:-- "Where is the middle of the world?"
So the miller laid down a rod, and he said:--"Here, set a hoop about the world, and thou will find the middle here."
The third was:--"What is the world's worth?"
"Well," said the miller, "the Saviour was sold for thirty pieces of silver, I am sure the world is worth no more."
"Oh," said the brother who was riding beside us, "that's not the way I have heard it.
The second was," "How long will it take to go round the world?"
And the miller said:-- "If I were as swift as the sun and moon, I would run it in twenty-four hours."
And the third was:-- "What is my thought?"
And the miller answered:-- "I can tell: Thou thinkest that I am thy scholar, but I am thy brother, the miller."
The following are a few riddles of the same kind, collected at Gairloch, for Osgood Mackenzie, Esq., by Mr. Donald MacDonald: 1.

There were three soldiers coming home on furlough, and their three wives with them; they came to a river over which there was a ferry, but the boat would take with it but two together.
The question is, how did they make the passage, for no one of them would trust his wife with another man, unless he was himself beside her?
Two women went over first, one went on shore, and the other came back with the boat, and she took the third with her, one of them went back and she stood beside her own husband, and the two husbands of the women who were over went back with the boat; one of them went on shore, and the wife of the man who was in the boat went into her along with him, and they went to the other side.
His wife went on shore, and the man who was yonder came in the boat; then the two men went over; then there were three men over, and a woman; this woman took over the other women by the way of one and one; and there seem to be more solutions than one for the problem.
