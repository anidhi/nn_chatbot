Gypsy Folk Tales: Chapter VIII. Welsh-Gypsy Stories: No. 61.--The Dragon
A lord, his wife, and his daughter live at a great castle.
A poor lad is engaged to mind the sheep.
The daughter gives him bread and beer in a basket for lunch.
The old lord explains that previous servants have always come back with one cow short.
In the field a little man comes to Jack.
Jack gives him as much as he can eat; and the little man gives Jack a plum.
The little man explains that a giant in a neighbouring castle steals a cow daily.
He gives Jack a pennyworth of pins, and bids him put them in the giant's drink.
Jack goes to the giant, and asks for work.
The giant goes to get drinks, and Jack mixes up the pins in the giant's glass.
The giant drinks, falls ill, and dies.
Jack tells the little man how he has fared, and returns with the full tale of cows.
The master is surprised.
Presently his daughter comes in.
She tells Jack that to-morrow she is to be killed by a dragon, and would like him to be there to see.
Jack refuses, but gives the girl a plum, which she eats.p.
