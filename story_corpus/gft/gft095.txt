Gypsy Folk Tales: Chapter III. Bukowina-Gypsy Stories: No. 35.--The Lying Story

And there was no one to go, so I went alone to the.
forest.
And I found roast starlings in the hollow of a tree.
I put in my hand, and could not draw it out.
I took and got right in, and the hole closed up.
I set out and went to my godfather to borrow the axe.My godfather said, 'The servant with the axe is not at home, but,' said my godfather, 'I will give you the hatchet, and the hatchet is expecting little hatchets.
''Never fear, godfather.
'And he gave me the hatchet, and I went and cut my way out of the tree, and I flung down the hatchet.
Whilst it was falling a bird built its nest in the handle, and laid eggs, and hatched them, and brought forth young ones; and when the hatchet had fallen down, it gave birth to twelve little hatchets.
And I put them in my wallet, and carried them to my godfather.
My godfather rejoiced.
He gave me one of the hatchets, and I stuck it in my belt at my back, and went home.

The well was deep.
I cut off my brainpan, and drank water out of it.
I laid my brainpan by the well, and went home.p.
