Gypsy Folk Tales: Chapter IV. Transylvanian-Gypsy Stories: No. 37.--The Creation of the Violin
p. 131 IN a hut on a mountain, in a fair forest, lived a girl with her four brothers, her father, and her mother.
The sister loved a handsome rich huntsman, who often ranged the forest, but who would never speak to the pretty girl.
Mara wept day and night, because the handsome man never came near her.
She often spoke to him, but he never answered, and went on his way.
She sang the song:'Dear man from a far country, Slip your hand into mine; Clasp me, an you will, in your arms; Lovingly will I kiss you.'
