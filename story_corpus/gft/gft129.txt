Gypsy Folk Tales: Chapter VIII. Welsh-Gypsy Stories: No. 69.--The Fool with the Sheep
The youngest of three brothers is a fool, and the two others want to kill him.
They induce him to get into a sack as the way to go to heaven.
He does so, and they take him to the sea.
They stop for a drink at a tavern.
A stranger comes by with sheep.
He wants to go, and takes Jack's place, and is thrown into the sea.
Jack returns with the sheep.
The brothers find him at home with his flock, and ask where he got them.
'At the bottom of the sea.'
They want to go too, so Jack throws them in, and returns home.One of the Boswells remarked to me twenty odd years ago, 'The folks hereabouts are a lot of r√°tfalo heathens; they all think they are going to heaven in a sack.'
Our story is a very widespread one, A Polish-Gypsy fragment of it was printed as a specimen by Kopernicki (Gypsy Lore Journal, iii.
132); and it occurs also in Grimm ('The Little Peasant,' No.
61, i.
264, 422), Campbell of Islay ('The Three Widows,' p. 263
