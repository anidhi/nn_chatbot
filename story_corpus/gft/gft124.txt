Gypsy Folk Tales: Chapter VIII. Welsh-Gypsy Stories: No. 64.--The Ten Rabbits
In a little house on the hill lived an old woman with her three sons, the youngest of them a fool.
The eldest goes to seek his fortune, and tells his mother to bake him a cake.
'Which will you have--a big one and a curse with it, or a little one and a blessing in it?'
He chooses a big cake.
He comes to a stile and a beautiful road leading to a castle; he knocks at the castle door, and asks the old gentleman for work.
He is sent into a field with the gentleman's rabbits.
He eats his food, and refuses to give any to a little old man who asks for some.
The rabbits run here and there.
He tries to catch them, but fails to recover half of them.
The gentleman counts them, and finds some missing, so cuts the eldest brother's head off, and sticks it on a gatepost.
The second brother acts in the same way, and meets the same fate.
The fool also will seek his fortune.
He chooses a little cake with a blessing.
His mother sends him with a sieve to get water for her.
A robin bids him stop up the holes with leaves and clay.
He does so, and brings water.
He gets the cake and goes.
He sees his two brothers' heads stuck on the gateposts, and stands laughing at them, saying, 'What are you doing there, you two fools?'
and throwing stones at them.
He enters, dines, and smiles at the old gentleman's daughter, who falls in love with him.
He goes to the field, lets the rabbits go, and falls asleep.
The rabbits run about here and there.
An old man by the well begs food, and Jack shares his food with him.
Jack hunts for hedgehogs.
He can't get the rabbits back, but the old man gives him a silver whistle.
Jack blows, and the rabbits return.
The old gentleman counts them, and finds them correct.
The girl brings Jack his dinner daily in the field.
The old man tells Jack to marry her.
He does so, still living as servant in the stable till the old people's death.p.
