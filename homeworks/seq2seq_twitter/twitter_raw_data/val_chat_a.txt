i should do another poll about how excited people are about , the new chat client that google's rumored to be launching this week.
that's not how you play the knockout game
"happy talk."
thanks for the rt. totally appreciate it. hope it helps others.

new phone .. who's this ?
we need to make up our minds,how long we are going to tolerate this nonsense.they have bomb,qe have,need to strategise.

i just read 13 days by rfk. that was enough to terrify me thinking of trump v putin in a similar scenario.
my heart is so broken? (not)
thanks guys for the rt. i appreciate you sharing my story.
that's ok. the melo 2003 team was not ranked in the pre-season polls either.
don't understand why they so surprised the fbi didn't see it coming. hillary has basically spat on them &amp; got away with it.
some guy online supposedly sentenced for 7 yrs for making his gf walk in cold, naked bc of cheating texts allegedly.
i know , he would never duck and drive.

wow do people live under a rock? lol cause that's crazy it's 2016. i would think people atleast get what a vegetarian is.
in retrospect, here's what drove me the most crazy about google's moonshots &amp; their past failures with partnerships. gmail &amp; docs, yes.

you shouldn't ask loaded questions; it's rude. and hilllary helped kill millions in iraq, syria, libya, honduras &amp; yemen and..
can humanity save itself from humanity?
me too i'm getting excited!!!
disproportionate response is the only winning strategy. "how are you?" "imagine the worst day of your life. twice that bad."
that's golden
so many ways to fail, so few to succeed.
heart-breakingly, that's a well-chosen example.
dinner date of our lovely couple ❤️♥️🇺🇸
i’m pretty amazed at the branding power that sapphire has. seems like lots of friends got it just because it was sapphire branded

but i like some canned foods
simple. because it's badass and ben plays the best jim gordon ever. saved a click.
tbh we need to address all crime, no matter who commits it, and who it's on. because everyone is someone's daughter/son/dad etc

donald trump had a heart attack and died
👍👍 i'm pleased i managed that much on an off day

also keeping the 3 lane 1 way 👌🏼. watch every morning as dozens of cyclists bike opposite direction of these lanes to get to bart
not casey and yes, not bastian
no, you have twitter issues. don't push your twitter issues on me!
oh she as dead as much as i wish trap music would be.
i don't gotta go but my keys are in there
if wants to win, it is inexplicable that while is in meltdown he starts a big fight with former rivals.
probably hit shanghai tunnel bar for a catchup with friends around 1930 if you'd like to join.
lmao i ain't even get to the real shit like baby doctor bills and diapers 😭😭 or my mental health
asking twitter folks as i think you're more familiar w/the narrative than most, so your reaction may be a better guage than rotten tomatoes
no give me other ideas
i keep seeing this and someone is really looking to get their ass beat with this clown nonsense.
just be there to score the 8ball.

"before he was shot, police dashcam and helicopter footage shows, he had walked to his car with his hands held over his head"
ok brows are where i'll draw the line, but do u. do u.
golly gee, how could anyone in the black/latino world not be enthused with a pandering, patronizing, do nothing.
this is the most biked to bart station.
ah! well if you feel like leaving the airport for a beer or something, i’ll be around :)
you think saying a welfare state has "strong social protections" means something about my beliefs? how so? just stating a fact
might be the best
jk looked at the hashtag lmfao
what is this guy saying? just in case bbc asks me something similar and my little pea brain explodes....(which i doubt)
you think? trump will eliminate social security and obamacare which will force seniors to sell their real estate
probably because you lack the high level statistical training to grasp cc
also can we talk about lucas's foot work?!? chris brown who???
bob you're not smart
fyi. it uses the same flight number each year.
trump would probably hate that today i watched a black man and a latino man do heimlich 10 times on a white man who was choking.
yeah, but it's starting out by saying "you think i'm right, right." and what do you think of hillary's warmongering record?
ur not even patient or wise ur the worst magical negro ive ever encountered
i was getting really really bad threats so i switched my handle from sarah to amy (my middle name) to avoid them.
which graphing platforms?
ok, i'll retweet!
joepa was the ceo of penn st. football. he employed serial child rapist for 40 years. and you believe he never had inkling?

clowns are evil. why can't people understand this?!
the concealer, brow gel, primer, lip balm --am dying 4 dem all
its a shame that we have problems like this. police need to be re-trained by the masses and gun control laws need pushed.
they'll say the kids aren't jewish. duh!
my god, man, he kept his mouth shut between 2001 and 2011, just like curley, schulz and the rest. more kids harmed. sad.
my apple black silicone case came today,but yeah man keep that in a nice case,no cheap shit lol

omg,carol. so sorry,that's awful. we had fraud on a couple credit card apps but it was caught in time.but ur checking, terrible.
i know it was milap!
aggh, no...im not listening to that. im watching baseball. you can tell me what he said.
disagree probably got caught up on vax for early intervention
not the same but also awful. hillary is a corrupt warmonger who is pro-fracking. the fact you support that is shameful.
the only way i'd ever wear one of those is if someone puts me in it after i'm dead
great, now you've ruined skittles for me. 😢
it was happening a bunch in upstate new york and i was like "if a clown jump out at me i'm going to put my hands on them"
idk if it's walmart or target but my one friend finds mad pop punk cds i'm always like wtf
this is really about fans needing to feel good about childhood memories, so they don't feel as duped as sandusky's victims
i have filza installed,but damn i need my filza lol
well yeah. but she dead
i relate to this so hard
sadly the bills season already has 😢
i totally get it. but something about bringing something non human alive creeps me out
and with that the orioles fans are awake again
so sad. terrorists reign!
well really have you considered this point.... (ducks behind couch)
we feel ya, but no can do - they have a short shelf life because they're so fresh + have no preservatives!
not sure whether to laugh or cry... both? that pretty much sums up the prequels!
best of luck with your new group coach!
yea 16 was entertaining cause it was hilariously bad 17 is better but the bullshit just makes me want to play dora the explorer

honestly naomi was probably nicer than i would be.
why an unarmed black man killed in tulsa yet an fbi top ten wanted criminal just wounded in a shootout that injured 2 officers?
so true bro man appreciate your forward these past monts mann ! appreciate
i'm actually coming to the office tomorrow. will you be around after lunch after coffee?
i dislike this tweet immensely, i must say. it’s possibly my least favorite @ ever
yes, that was it. her promotion of hrc was disappointing b/c her rep w/ many rests on:
i miss you guys. i'm presenting in 15 minutes love to the gang!
if joepa didn't try to save his program humiliation, he at least displayed willful ignorance that allowed jerry to continue
once we're all dead it won't be the 518 anymore
i meant later tomorrow lol
1. yes, but you need official app (or web) to view. 2. thank you! 😋

i'm sure there are ways all of them can get off from being criminally negligent. morally repugnant? not a freakin' chance.
with our massively overbuilt roads + low population we should be leaders in cycling infrastructure.
all thanks to you 🌊🌊🌊
honestly i was waiting for it. the moment she said that foolishness i was like "here we go🙄🙄"
i'm pretty sure you ban guns, murder rates drop to 100 a year instead of thirty thousand
being anthropologists and uncovering emerging human needs and new problems to hack
i'm pretty sure down escalators are just up escalators being rewound.
sorry, meant "neighbors" in broadest, most figurative sense, as cornel west addressing everyone, "brother" or "sister"

curls, lipstick, choker, oh my!! look at you, beauty!

if he's a democrat he will be assumed to be a crook. dems i talk to say it will be a long time before they vote again
rock n roll over
lol everybody really does hate christian laettner.
like all the bonds he went bad on @ the taj that would elucidate4 bikers &amp;trumps other followers that he's just stooge 4bank fams
why was that lol
people are fuckin morbid, &amp; anybody with a weak mind can be easily inspired by a demon like trump
we're one and the same, that's why😉❣️
seriously peak clickbait.
that you and others spend this much time trying to clear name of your coach but not helping is shameful.
don't worry austin we can go get icecream
i think you just accidentally pitched breaking bad with clowns- and i'm not mad at it.
not justin.....
new tune star is out
action first, then talk later 💅🏼
iris pls don't give james /basti a hard time, he loves you with all his heart and soul♥️❤️❤️❤️🇺🇸

lol!! oly must be so big by now! any garbage rummaging yet? glad to hear you're well!
i would've come to and turnt up in the waiting room

you guys are such a cute family!

sir, some perspective?
as a matter of fact, it does!
they all knew -- but he was one of the most popular man in the state. he could have had curley or schulz's pink slip.
hey! what's flybarre?
i can't do college anymore i'm dropping out its been fun
it's bra strap length when stretched. right above my shoulder blades with shrinkage.
i am talking to liberals, not trump
yes, they all can't be cute, happy puppy pictures lol.
wrong. it wasn't just him. hillary voted for the iraq war even though she knew it was wrong:
it's crazy cause we were sorry we have friends from other teams like your guys parishville gfs😊

i did indeed make an appearance in my own talk
give tabitha my math.

software is ideology
blanche would be totally into that overly sexual world of hellraiser
"my infant stuffed soggy biscuits in the console. what do i do?! i turned around for literally 10 seconds!"
put em out to pasture.
i'm sorry i've got no patience for enablers -- and you're one. that's just the truth. you still don't get who this is about
first you sell your startup. then you write your "how i did it" medium post. then you open your wifi-free hipster coffee shop
love and miss you so much more💕😚
so did bill clinton, weak argument
yes. i remember. that was part of her pro-hrc position.

maybe? far more wrong than right. space jam on that list = dead to me
are you taking into account the emails still to come out and speech transcripts that someone out there is sitting on?
i'm coming. thanks.
i don't have time for fanboys. it's frankly embarrassing. i'm glad you have your own support group, though
dragging them in regards to the bedroom. his dick was small, she was hoe, the sex was wack, he stinks... blah blah
well that settles it. let's go halfsies on a gay club, that only plays euro-disco, and call it l'anus.

update: it was actually more like 150 years ago, and we came in via london, where we had gone to escape pogroms.
i was laughing too hard to convince anyone anything. but she got some harsh enough responses from the people she called
could it b their biggest profits come from, pain,anxiety,depression, and sleep medications &amp; their fake weed.

of course i do! you're one of my biggest fans! i'm so excited to see you and all of your classmates 👯👯👯
i expose and knock out weak liberals as a hobby, i will expose you too
we probably agree on every other issue in america except this one. people that really love their school hold it accountable
you're the best; can't wait to see where you go next!
that's some hood shit kalia
he's a trumper..iq 70 or below
side stepping that the profitable arms deal was illegal under federal law. why it was secret.

you know norbert?!
or something like this
at least you caught it , skipper.
thanks for showin love❤️
the 1 good point ny made is that crocs allow for a little foot breathing room which helps me in the long run👃🏼♨️
the fbi needs a new leader now. when they allowed hillary to get away after bill's private meeting with the ag, it shows.
please play
absolutely!! did you see this? you gotta wonder how tells her family she is helping djt.
ha i saw an original mug from star trek the motion picture today at the landfill.
oh no gross. lol ☇☇
perhaps oversimplification, but still an artificial contrivance that blew up in your faces. reap what you sow. sycophantic media.
i've been trying to get to focus on this: trump found donated to 2x 501(c)4 lobbying firms, incl
ah i've just had that weirdly happen with out scratches from the cat, just hanging out on me and pressed on my arm
&amp; didn't stop there. deplorable.
when you're not practicing let's go 😂

that's a very true statement
do a red brown!!!!
i'm no md, but 'red lines going up arm' is nothing to fuck with. could be an infection in the veins.
😱😱😱 cuddle sesh when this comes out
aldos! it's named after a sleazy nightclub (right at the hill)i remember when it burned down hemmel had some sly joke about it
yes oliver !!!! congrats
the ferocity of her expression adds so much depth to her!i automatically imagine some backstory where she was wronged &amp; driven mad
i'm writing a song with a v similar statement as the chorus
you gotta get your shit together right away
if you’re being picky, my definition does require that the path lead home, so those don’t count.

gore refused to move from clintons' horrid third way policies that brought the welfare bill and crime bill. that's their fault
blm founded by obama, racial injustice founded by the democrats, bigotry founded by dems, try again! you morons have to do better
i just wanna know how you can be that stupid to try anything like that in the juggette barn.

all true. but no one does 2 year contracts anymore. it's all monthly spread out payments now.

terminal chokepoint(and also "picks &amp; shovels" oppty) of smart contracts is hardened data sources; nobody has a clue how to solve it.
main issue is 50% loss of highway capacity. political non-starter (for now). making bus lane in both directions more possible.

clearly you didn't see the first goal,
possibly, but she sure seems to do it for adulation rather than altruism, just my opinion
ain't got no qualms about putting some out there...that's what i do
i don't read or listen to political talking points, this way i don't repeat them sem querer.
but of course, you don't carry cash, so you sigh and tell them you'll come back. "oh we do too"
awww! i'm a little in love!
thanks stud. really appreciate that
i walk around looking like garbage and don't even have this excuse if that helps

this is true, but white supremacy is not based on fear. the assertion of supremacy through power is trump's appeal.
no, it's a vote for stein. and if it's against both hillary and trump, then it's a vote that helps both, too. wake up.
u left me 🙄 wtf is happening this can't happen ever again. i'll be home tomorrow

very strange how little classism i used to see. i mistook opportunity afforded to me as opportunity afforded to everyone
and theres something really wrong with voting for a corrupt warmonger like hillary who helped kill hundreds of thousands.
a vile father brings up vile children who say stupid things and kill innocent animals. right?

i'm surprised that he was so surprised. i mean....
we never thought she did
this is how i feel when i put on a condom
i wish i was better at playing them. nope, i give up within 5 minutes

...but definitely a high budget reality show. something on mtv or cbs or the like.

he don't need to be on a diet

start here:
. they sure do. we practice advocacy for others...even though it isn't a standard.
i like the way you're thinking!! haha
nice core 4 sure. guess which one is not like the other? hint
he has a new job now which also means he has a new boss. why don't you try and call him now.

if the waiter doesn't say it, does that imply you made a bad choice?
youll find your pic in my trash babe 😉
luckily, you can totally pull off the eyepatch look.
they told us we had a moral responsibility to prevent another hitler. but they never told us how to stop him. i'm not sure they even knew.
your brother is the wildest kid i've ever met &amp; it makes me feel content to know that he is still running amuck wreaking havoc

his country is composed of like 5 major cities, the rest is covered in snow.
lmao damn brett, but i couldn't tell you! i like miz though, he makes a great heel champ
mama i got cookies baking in the oven and not one but two scorching hot kettles of fresh tea coming…

totally. got very close to it.
i can't speak to the op costs of but i can say that members commit much capital to real projects that help many
that’s on facebook. so. things like this just look cryptic. here’s a few phots from that post…
ohhhh lol, i thought you were already on your shit?
i had little excuse. i'd read it repeatedly and thoroughly before that. have a bmin. preached. what changed was an open mind.
okay, i just don't like the taboidism of it. i'll delete the tweet, it was pretty harsh
ok so we need a cnn that uses the webcam to distinguish chickens from foxes and control the coop door...
they've been coming out with stuff nonstop
it's not a rumor post from what i read just in mac rumors website
ultimately though i think "popular stories" and "trends" are the same thing.
that commentary would almost make me forgo my blind national allegiance and support alvarez... almost.

i appreciate the earnest attempt. 👍
it's not a good film. if they did a remake properly. it could be so creepy. not that god awful remake a few years ago. so bad
the more money ufc draws, the more confident they'll be in doing what they want. this puts more pressure on fighters
people think she's just as dishonest and a national security risk.
lol--i have not heard anyone more knowledgeable that he in bb or fb. his ego is off the charts.. forgettaboutit
that's straight from the camera
what another spineless liberal
only get to see her once a week
now with actual picture
not ufc. fighters will have to adapt and evolve.
i did it in my bathroom. it looked like shit and everyone in school called me speed racer because my hair looked like a helmet.
oh good lord. there is no racism against white people. i'm white. i can't be victimized by our racist system that favors whiteness.
everyone is watching fox is still talking about the birther thing
how do you stop a fascist when every social structure - and half the nation - are set up to help him succeed?
want that on my tombstone
computer screens
season is over, and this fucking prick swanson all he does is get hits, it sickens me
trump = the grift that keeps on grifting.
oh boo, sir. chilcott got hurt.
i mean. he's not wrong. unless they're into that...

gronk owner. should i use my overall waiver on tamme. currently have virgil green.

well, i guess that's one good thing about a sep 26 internal deadline....

trump knows he's gop. hell lester and him golf together. he's trying to set up hillary
your at their fucking hotel fuckig leave ( not you ) that's their place to sleep and relax not meet fans.
aint jackin
there are three things i love about that gif.. 1 is the prancing, 2nd is the suit and 3rd is... what was the third again?
not sure why the fact that trump could appoint up to 3 ultra conservative supreme court justices isn't a bigger deal
i literally tweeted her and was like "let her know!"
i just cried enough for the both of us. u good fam.
that's actually a great compromise. i will tweet this exact thing.
. a cop @ 42nd &amp; madison gave me a "we've got your back" smile this weekend as i crossed the street. ny's finest!

i'm sure pedroia and or bogey may say something

they really dont fear these souls. white supremacy is based on power *over* these souls. it's the mother of racism.
if they cant make it how can anyone
offer is on the table
yeah and i had to park like way over by cold stone
i don't think they'll unionize. ufc is their only platform, they can't make more money elsewhere. they'd be stuck tbh.
a full day later and i'm shocked you're the only one who thought it was strange. "rackety" is a thing now i guess. 💁

chippy drinking full cups of vodka is one of my fondest memories of her

im pretty sure thats not what he was trained to do. if he did the be some sort of consequence
sanchez is to the yankees what is to sports talk radio

we gave up protests/boycotts when we thought we "made it" 'cause flip &amp; redd was on the tv!
what's your setlist
damn, kinda hard to pick just one. i'd say "round here" because the beginning just gets me super hype. 🐝🌊
but as this woman struggled and pushed through the poses i thought of my mother and how she would have loved the challenge.
m.freeman:joe and ken were made for one another, bar would understand, she'd move on.
maybe we'll write one called buzzsaw lightyear just to come full circle. you sing backup?

now let's bring back g4 programming, attack of the show and the screen savers!!😎
need a little patience.
entertainment is the major industry in l.a. some don't realize that when they complain about celebrity news in local news.
are my feelings rooted in jealousy? perhaps it is because i wouldn't feel confident with my fat neck
i clearly hit a nerve. we knew jill was going to lose. you're the one who's clearly butthurt because hillary is going to lose.
oh crap i am already i need it 👀👀▶️🐼
because i cant reward myself like that
thank you for telling the truth 👏🏻👏🏻
i love it so much. going to the transit museum on friday and want to yell at everyone for not giving darius a job
ok, i'll try…
good to see i'm not the only one with way too many one sheets laying around

love it. you look beautiful.
thank you ❤️
that sounds 💣 af
matte black. still grippier than the 6s.
it won't be you!! wow! what a resume!😂
because they figured their chances were better holding us without a 1st down than to get the first and continue the drive.
lol! still on point. but c'mon bud, we can't let hillary back in the whitehouse.
try nab and i believe the affinity groups might break it out. my best source is

haha...so true! headed to see what went on with giants and cards tonight. very close race for first loser. :-)
i'll be there too guys
agree, never watch
lmfao i'm glad. it would be so sad to see it end 😔.
i'd venture to guess that most ppl hear an alarm and think "annoyance" rather than "emergency"
exactly, high school was dumbass fun, you just had to be around the right people
my daughter already picked 'to the left'.....lol
but i want peppermint!!
its bad out here..with this election must be the worst ive seen in my lifetime..
that's what i am here for

glad u'r enjoying, just figured out how 2c what it is
wheeeeeew how'd they miss that
i get this weird feeling that when airbnb's co-founders say refugees , they mean anywhere the hell away from them.
conspiracy theories. he's insane.
a lot more than trump.
scariest part is the bounce back. if trump times one of those right before nov 8, he could win.
come play it in new york

he was wearing underwear- we saw the raw in edit version🙄
lie after lie after lie. if they're not white supremacists and deplorable people, just how stupid are trump's supporters?!
watching the current election season, there is clearly one banana-skunk flavor candidate. it's the other candidate.
this drug's fda "approval" is the right step forward for this rare disease
