why are people so mad at jimmy fallon? the problem isn't that trump is on tv, it's that he's a presidential candidate.
i don’t know if i would call 6 bankruptcies successful. you look at his failed businesses schemes the scary trump university
trump's entire campaign is based on hatred of women and minorities. xenophobic, bigoted, and racist. very disappointed in jimmy fallon.
please explain to me the logistics of any potus creating a nazi regime in the united states.
